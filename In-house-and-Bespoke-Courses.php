            <p>Metadata Training was one of the first companies to deliver business analysis courses in the UK and we’ve successfully done this for 25+ years. For a few years we’ve also delivered agile, TOGAF and PRINCE2 training.Finding the right training provider is not easy. We are sharing with you some feedback we received from one of our recent in-house training to give you an idea of what to expect from us.” The in-house Requirements Engineering course was excellent and delivered on all our expectations.

            <h3>Cable and Wireless</h3>
            <p>Cable & Wireless is one of the world’s leading international communications companies. As part of their commitment to development and training for their people, Cable & Wireless asked Metadata to propose a programme of training to enable their Business Analysts to achieve the highly valued ISEB Business Analysis Diploma. A key objective was to minimise the impact on their business so we designed a series of one day courses to run every fortnight on Mondays. The training programme ran for over six months and by the end the Business Analysts had achieved a 100% success rate in the ISEB certificate exams.</p>
